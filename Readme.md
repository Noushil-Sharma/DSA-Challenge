## About

In this repository, you will find a variety of DSA challenges that cover a wide range of topics such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and more. Each challenge is accompanied by a problem statement and a solution implemented in a programming language of your choice.

## Challenges

The challenges in this repository are organized into separate folders, each representing a specific DSA topic. Within each folder, you will find individual challenge files along with their respective problem statements and solution templates. Feel free to explore and attempt the challenges in any order you prefer.

You can solve the challenges using any programming language you are comfortable with. If a challenge already has a solution, you can still attempt it and compare your solution with the existing one. Additionally, you can contribute your own solutions in different languages or propose new challenges to further enrich the repository.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are more than welcome! If you have a new challenge idea, feel free to open an issue to discuss it. If you want to contribute a solution, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name for your solution.
3. Implement your solution in the programming language of your choice.
4. Add the problem statement within the challenge's folder and name it appropriately.
5. Add your solution file with a clear and concise name that reflects the problem and the programming language used.
6. Commit and push your changes to your forked repository.
7. Open a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository.

Please make sure to follow the existing folder structure and naming conventions when adding new challenges or solutions.
